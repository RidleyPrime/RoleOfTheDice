    //controls what class we are in, modifying the speed and defense values, along with changing the attack function, animations, and model.


    /* 1: thief = moves quick, low range, squishy. High DPS knives. excels at hitting one enemy a lot in close range
     * 2: Ranger = single target ranged arrow attack, moves quick, squishy. Excels at taking out enemies from afar or fighting ranged battles, but suffers in close range
     * 3: Wizard = slow ranged aoe lighting bolt that roots them in place to use, but is devastating burst damage. poor against fast moving enemies
     * 4: Warrior = great dps, decent tankiness. Standard longsword. Good in most situations, but doesn't excel in any.
     * 5: Lancer = poke with spear, need to hit with tip to get good dps, requiring repositioning. great for 1 on 1s
     * 6: Paladin = Very tanky, slow aoe hammer attacks in a decent range, good vs swarms / hordes
